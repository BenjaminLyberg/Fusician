This assignment has made us face many issues for the first time, and shown us a great deal of how powerful Rails are.
The main surprise was how fast you can go from nothing to something that works, and use different gems to create a unique solution.

Some of the cool functions we've added so far is
- User registration                 (Devise)
- Image uploading                   (Paperclip)
- Upvote function                   (Act's as votable)
- Connect to other users            (Has friendship)
- Payment for premium membership    (Stripe)
- Sending email to users            (ActionMailer)
- Admin overview and privileges     (RailsAdmin)


Due to timeconstraints we couldn't fullfill all the functions we visualised, and
ideas for future modifications are 
- Ability to edit your own profile from profile itself, instead of using a edit form.
- Ability to search for other critera than location
- Ability to customize own profile even more, with more photos etc.
- Messaging system for interaction between users
- Various design changes
