This assignment has made us face many issues for the first time, and shown us a great deal of how powerful Rails are.
The main surprise was how fast you can go from nothing to something that works, and use different gems to create a unique solution.

Some of the cool functions we've added so far is
- User registration                 (Devise)
- Image uploading                   (Paperclip)
- Upvote function                   (Act's as votable)
- Connect to other users            (Has friendship)
- Payment for premium membership    (Stripe)
- Sending email to users            (ActionMailer)
- Admin overview and privileges     (RailsAdmin)



Ideas for future modifications are 
- Possibility to own profile from profile itself, instead of using a form.
- Possibility to search for other critera than location
